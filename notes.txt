Key points from various contests

USACO 2022 Dec Silver Problem 1: Barn Tree


- Tree DP
- Assume subtree v works, DFS u = make subtree u work without changing v
- Only moves are to take or give to parent
- Problem is might take more than parent has, therefore need to change order of operations
- How to order operations?
- 1. Sort children based on sum of h[i] within child subtree
- 2. Topological sort technique

USACO 2022 Dec Silver Problem 2: Circular Barn

- Prime numbers: Sieve, O(sqrt(N)) to get factors
- How many prime numbers less than 5e6? 
- Farmer John loses N=1 when a1 = 0 (mod 4)
- Precompute for each prime how long it take for it to become 0
- Find first barn to become 0, that determines who wins

USACO 2022 Dec Silver Problem 3: Range Reconstruction

- Assume 1 .. i works then add i+1
- Only need to check a[i][i+1] to make array !
- 2 choices for each element ans[i-1] + a[i][i+1], ans[i-1] - a[i][i+1], if one doesn't work take the other


DMOPC 2022 Contest 2 P2: Line Trace

- Answer is number of inversions
- A connector that connects line i with i+1 swaps i and i+1 in the answer

YAC 5 P2: Big Score

- Lexographically greatest array must be Josh
- Since each of Josh's moves removed two coins from a vault and added one coin to a vault left of vault , the leftmost vault operated on by Josh must contain more coins than it had originally.
- Conversely, since each of Nils's moves removed two coins from a vault  and added one coin to a vault right of vault , the leftmost vault operated on by Nils must contain fewer coins than it had originally.
- Lexographically smallest array is Nils

AAC 7 P3: Squirrel Scramble

- Only ever use portal once, arrive at nearest portal to destination
- For node i, there will always be a k such that it is optimal to walk to each node from i to k-1 and use a portal to reach node k ... n

AAC 4 P2: Lavish Lights

- Array b where b[i] is the LCM of a[1] ... a[i]
- Stop when b > 1e9 !! (because t[i] <= 1e9 and cannot be a multiple of anything > 1e9)
- Binary search for last index i such that t[i] = 0 (mod b[i])
- i+1 is answer

AAC 4 P3: Snowy Slopes

- x[j]-x[i]/y[j] - y[i] = k[a]/d[a] for indices i, j, a
- d[a](x[j] - x[i]) = k[a](y[j]-y[i])
- d[a]*x[j] - k[a]*y[j] = d[a]*x[i] - k[a]*y[i]
- store frequency counts of d[a]*x[i] - k[a]*y[i] for each a and i
- combinatorics to get answer
